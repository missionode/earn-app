* **UPI Integration (Partial):** Basic functionality to initiate UPI payments (implementation pending).
* **Offline Support:** Works offline thanks to service worker caching.
* **Installable:** Can be installed on the user's home screen for a native app-like experience.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Local Storage (for data persistence)
* Service Worker (for offline support)

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd earn-app
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in a browser:** You can simply open the file directly in your browser.  For full PWA functionality (like installability and offline support), you'll need to serve it over HTTPS.  You can use a local development server like:
    * **Python's Simple HTTP Server:** `python -m http.server` (Python 3) or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python 2)
    * **Node.js's `http-server`:** (Install globally: `npm install -g http-server`, then run: `http-server`)

## Important Notes

* **Local Storage:** The app currently uses local storage to store transaction data. This means data is stored only within the user's browser and is not persistent across devices or if the browser data is cleared.
* **UPI Integration:** The UPI integration is a placeholder.  Implementing actual UPI transactions requires server-side integration with a payment gateway and handling security considerations carefully.
* **Icons:** Ensure that you have all the necessary SVG icons in the `assets/icons/` directory for the app to function correctly.

## Future Enhancements

* **Database Integration:** Replace local storage with a database (e.g., Firebase, MySQL) for persistent data storage and user accounts.
* **Complete UPI Implementation:** Integrate with a payment gateway to enable real UPI transactions.
* **User Authentication:** Add user login/registration.
* **Data Synchronization:** Implement data synchronization across devices.
* **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the user interface and user experience.
* **More Advanced Analytics:** Provide more detailed reports and visualizations of spending habits.
