# NexaForge Generic Technology and Implementation Architecture

This document defines a language-neutral technology-selection policy for applications built under the NexaForge collaboration loop. It is the implementation companion to [`communication-architecture.md`](./communication-architecture.md); it is not the architecture of `loop.md`.

The communication model, safety rules, local-first process, evidence levels, and testing standards are reusable across programming languages, frameworks, transports, databases, deployment models, and application domains. A project selects a concrete implementation profile during preflight and records the choice in `HANDOFF.md`.

## Core decision

Do not treat the technology choices in this document as mandatory products. Treat them as capability requirements and selection criteria.

```text
Generic architecture and invariants
  -> project constraints and product needs
  -> implementation profile
  -> dependency preparation
  -> local proof and validation
  -> measured production decision
```

Every implementation must preserve the generic communication contracts, security controls, local-first validation model, checkpoint process, and evidence classifications even when its tools differ.

## Technology decision matrix

| Capability | Required decision | Selection rule |
|---|---|---|
| Primary language | Project-selected | Choose a maintained language with suitable libraries, tooling, security support, and local compatibility. |
| Application framework | Project-selected or minimal runtime | Use a framework when it reduces risk; avoid adopting one without a measured need. |
| Public transport | Project-selected adapter | Choose HTTP, WebSocket, SSE, QUIC, messaging, native IPC, or another transport according to client and delivery needs. |
| Protocol format | Project-selected | JSON is the default interoperable format; use a typed or binary format when measured requirements justify it. |
| Route/message model | Required | Use versioned envelopes, schemas, owners, policies, correlation, idempotency, and observability. |
| Durable data store | Project-selected | Choose a transactional database or equivalent durable store appropriate to consistency, query, scale, and retention needs. |
| Queue/cache/coordination | Conditional | Add only when required for asynchronous work, rate limits, locks, pub/sub, or short-lived state. |
| Background execution | Project-selected | Use processes, workers, jobs, actors, functions, containers, or platform tasks as appropriate. |
| Frontend | Project-selected | Use the smallest client technology that satisfies the product and accessibility requirements. |
| Styling/design system | Project-selected | Define semantic tokens, responsive behavior, focus states, and component states before feature UI. |
| Ingress and transport security | Project-selected | Use a maintained proxy, gateway, platform ingress, or direct secure runtime with documented TLS and origin controls. |
| Testing | Required layers | Use static, unit, protocol, runtime, browser, security, load, and manual evidence only where applicable. |
| Dependency management | Project-selected | Use a lockfile, trusted package source, reproducible install, audit, and documented versions. |
| Source history | Local Git preferred | Initialize local Git in the target project when possible; continue with file snapshots if unavailable. |

## Implementation profile

Before implementation, record one concrete profile. The profile may be a monolith, modular monolith, service-based system, serverless system, desktop application, mobile application, CLI, library, embedded application, or another justified shape.

```text
profileName: <name>
scope: production-shaped | protocol-proof | technical-spike
language: <language and version>
framework: <framework and version, or none>
client: <browser | native | CLI | service | none>
publicTransport: <HTTP | WebSocket | SSE | QUIC | IPC | none | other>
protocolFormat: <JSON | MessagePack | Protobuf | other>
durableStore: <database or none>
queueOrCoordination: <technology or none>
backgroundExecution: <worker/process/function/actor/none>
frontend: <technology or none>
styling: <technology or none>
ingressAndTLS: <proxy/platform/direct/none>
testRunner: <tool>
browserRunner: Playwright | not-applicable
activeComponents: <list>
deferredComponents: <list>
notApplicableComponents: <list with reasons>
fallbacks: <list>
```

The profile must explain why each major choice fits the product, machine, delivery target, security model, and proof scope. It must identify installed, missing, incompatible, cached, and deferred dependencies.

## Generic application structure

Use boundaries that fit the selected language and framework. Names may change, but responsibilities remain clear:

```text
application/
├── protocol/          # envelopes, schemas, codecs, transport adapters
├── routes/            # versioned route registry and policy metadata
├── domain/            # business rules and domain modules
├── application/       # commands, queries, workflows, use cases
├── infrastructure/   # persistence, queues, external systems, telemetry
├── tasks/             # asynchronous task contracts and workers
├── client/            # optional browser, native, CLI, or service client
└── tests/             # static, unit, protocol, runtime, browser, and load tests
```

The transport layer routes messages and enforces boundary controls. Domain modules own business decisions. Long-running, resource-sensitive, or resumable work uses the project’s selected worker model while preserving the Ghost task invariants defined in `communication-architecture.md`.

## Protocol and transport implementation

The protocol is transport-neutral. A project may expose it through one or more adapters:

```text
Client
  -> transport adapter
  -> frame/message decoder
  -> version and schema validation
  -> authentication/session checks
  -> route policy and rate limits
  -> route handler or task scheduler
  -> response/event/progress adapter
```

WebSocket is supported but not required for every project. If WebSocket is selected, apply the WebSocket security controls in `loop.md` and `communication-architecture.md`. If another transport is selected, document its equivalent origin, authentication, authorization, framing, replay, backpressure, and connection controls.

The selected transport must support the required application behaviors or document a safe fallback for:

- Request/response
- Commands and queries
- Events and subscriptions
- Progress and completion
- Cancellation and expiry
- Reconnect and resume where applicable
- Correlation and tracing
- Idempotency and duplicate delivery
- Payload limits and backpressure
- Binary or large-payload transfer where applicable

## Data, persistence, and consistency

Choose durable storage according to the application’s consistency, query, scale, privacy, retention, and recovery needs.

Required rules:

- Use migrations or an equivalent repeatable schema process.
- Use transactions or equivalent atomic operations for related state changes.
- Use unique constraints or equivalent invariant enforcement for idempotency.
- Persist durable task state before starting asynchronous execution.
- Persist results before publishing completion.
- Use an outbox or equivalent consistency pattern when state changes and event publication must be coordinated.
- Do not use caches, browser storage, queues, or process memory as the only source of durable business truth.
- Define backup, restore, retention, deletion, and recovery expectations.

## Queues, workers, and Ghost execution

Queues, workers, actors, scheduled jobs, functions, and other execution systems are implementation choices. Their behavior must satisfy the generic Ghost contract:

```text
accepted task
  -> durable task record
  -> bounded execution
  -> lease/heartbeat/deadline where applicable
  -> checkpointing where required
  -> result persistence
  -> response/event publication
  -> acknowledgement and release
```

Every asynchronous task must define:

- Task identity and correlation fields
- Execution mode and capability limits
- Deadline, timeout, lease, or cancellation behavior
- Retry and idempotency policy
- Progress and checkpoint behavior
- Failure and dead-letter behavior
- Completion persistence and publication order
- Cleanup and worker-release behavior

Do not introduce a queue, cache, container, service, or worker pool solely because it is conventional. Add infrastructure when the product behavior, isolation, reliability, or measured load requires it.

## Client and frontend

The client may be a browser, native application, CLI, service, or no client at all. Client SDKs should own transport concerns rather than business rules:

- Connection or request lifecycle
- Authentication refresh where applicable
- Correlation and timeout handling
- Retry and reconnect behavior
- Subscription restoration and event sequencing
- Typed payload conversion
- Safe public error conversion
- Local test instrumentation

For browser applications, define responsive design tokens and component states before feature screens. The `.screen-brand-logo` rule is reusable where that component exists: use a maximum dimension of `80px` in horizontal flex rows, center standalone logos with a maximum width of `125px`, preserve aspect ratio, shrink inside narrow containers, and prevent horizontal overflow.

## Ingress, deployment, and scaling

Use the simplest local and deployment topology that meets the proof scope. Possible components include a development server, reverse proxy, platform ingress, TLS terminator, gateway, worker supervisor, scheduler, or direct application process.

Production or shared environments must document:

- Secure transport and certificate/trust mode
- Origin and host allowlists where relevant
- Process ownership and graceful shutdown
- Health/readiness checks
- Port and socket exposure
- Scaling boundaries and shared state
- Logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and redaction
- Backup, rollback, and recovery

Scale from measured connections, requests, messages, bytes, latency, CPU, memory, queue depth, storage, error rate, and reconnect behavior. Do not claim capacity without representative load evidence.

## Testing and quality

Required validation is proportional to the application profile:

- Static checks: syntax, types, configuration, formatting, dependency and schema checks.
- Unit checks: isolated domain rules, handlers, policies, codecs, and utilities.
- Protocol checks: envelope, framing, route, schema, correlation, error, idempotency, replay, and duplicate-delivery contracts.
- Runtime checks: real local processes, readiness, routes, persistence, workers, queues, timers, and cleanup.
- Security checks: threat model, secrets, authentication, authorization, injection, origin, rate limits, replay, safe errors, and auditability.
- Load checks: representative connections, requests, messages, payloads, latency, throughput, memory, queues, and failure recovery.
- Browser checks: headless Playwright for browser behavior whenever the application has a browser interface or browser evidence is relevant.
- Manual checks: optional human visual or exploratory review; never silently substitute for required automated evidence.

### Local-first headless Playwright standard

Codex may invoke Playwright automatically whenever browser behavior, browser protocol behavior, accessibility behavior, responsive behavior, or a browser release gate is relevant. A separate manual trigger is not required. Tests run against the local target application and local supporting services with disposable local data.

Use:

- Isolated browser contexts and deterministic fixtures
- Stable user-facing locators and web-first assertions
- No arbitrary sleeps or implementation-detail selectors
- Local mocks or controlled fixtures for third-party services
- Chromium headless as the default browser project
- Firefox/WebKit headless compatibility projects when required
- Zero local retries; CI retries only for diagnosis, with retry-passing tests reported as `FLAKY`
- Traces on first retry or failure
- Temporary screenshots only when page-design or responsive checks are in scope

Minimum responsive viewports when applicable:

```text
mobile:  390x844
tablet:  768x1024
desktop: 1440x900
```

Screenshots, traces, videos, browser contexts, cookies, local/session storage, reports, and temporary test data remain local to the task. Remove disposable artifacts and close browser contexts and processes after evaluation. Do not commit them or place secrets/private data in them. Missing browsers or unhealthy local services are `BLOCKED`, not application failures. Browser dependency installation that requires network access remains approval-gated.

Equivalent project commands should be documented when applicable, for example:

```text
<package-manager> run test:e2e
<package-manager> run test:e2e:critical
<package-manager> run test:e2e:report
```

## Dependency and source management

Before implementation:

- Inspect manifests, lockfiles, runtime versions, and package sources.
- Prefer reproducible lockfile installation.
- Record dependency status as available, cached, missing, incompatible, or blocked.
- Run dependency health, audit, type, lint, build, test-discovery, and local-start checks as applicable.
- Request one consolidated approval before network package, browser, toolchain, or system dependency installation.
- Never commit secrets, generated noise, browser artifacts, credentials, or unapproved files.

## Optional reference implementation profile: PHP/Laravel

The following is an example, not the generic default. Use it only when the project’s constraints and product needs justify it:

```text
language: PHP 8.5, with PHP 8.4 compatibility where required
framework: Laravel 13 modular monolith
public transport: Workerman-based secure WebSocket gateway
data format: JSON
durable store: PostgreSQL
queue/coordination: Redis or Valkey when required
background execution: Laravel queue workers implementing Ghost contracts
browser client: TypeScript SDK around the native WebSocket API
styling: Tailwind CSS v4
ingress: Nginx or Caddy
tests: PHPUnit/Pest, PHPStan, Pint or PHP CS Fixer, Playwright, protocol and load tests
```

This reference profile must not override a project’s declared language, framework, transport, database, or deployment requirements. Any substitution must be recorded with its effect on confidence and validation.

## Decisions still required from each project

- Product domain and route list
- Client types and supported platforms
- Language, framework, and version policy
- Transport and protocol format
- Authentication, session, and authorization model
- Durable entities, consistency, privacy, and retention
- File/media and payload limits
- Queue, worker, and task requirements
- Browser support and required Playwright projects
- Accessibility and responsive targets
- Concurrency, latency, availability, and recovery targets
- Deployment environment and operating system
- External services and managed infrastructure
- Selected security level and exclusions

## Confidence assessment

Confidence must be reported by capability, not assumed from the selected tools:

- Language/framework fit: <high | medium | low>
- Protocol and transport fit: <high | medium | low>
- Persistence and consistency fit: <high | medium | low>
- Worker/task fit: <high | medium | low>
- Browser and Playwright fit: <high | medium | low | not-applicable>
- Security evidence: <tested scope and remaining gaps>
- Production capacity: <measured | unmeasured>
- Overall architecture confidence: <high | medium | low>

No implementation profile is production-approved solely because its tools are popular or its tests pass. Report tested controls, untested controls, evidence level, open risks, and next validation step.
